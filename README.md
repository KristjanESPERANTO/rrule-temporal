# rrule-temporal

Recurrence rule (RFC 5545) processing using Temporal PlainDate/PlainDateTime.

This was created to advance the rrule library to use Temporal, and to provide a more modern API, as the original rrule library is [not maintained anymore](https://github.com/jkbrzt/rrule/issues/615). Maintainers suggested to use Temporal instead of Date:
