The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of
the week; SU indicates Sunday; MO indicates Monday; TU indicates
Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH indicates Thursday; FR
indicates Friday; and SA indicates Saturday.

Each BYDAY value can also be preceded by a positive (+n) or
negative (-n) integer.  If present, this indicates the nth
occurrence of a specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY "RRULE".


For example, within a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO)
represents the first Monday within the month, whereas -1MO
represents the last Monday of the month.  The numeric value in a
BYDAY rule part with the FREQ rule part set to YEARLY corresponds
to an offset within the month when the BYMONTH rule part is
present, and corresponds to an offset within the year when the
BYWEEKNO or BYMONTH rule parts are present.  If an integer
modifier is not present, it means all days of this type within the
specified frequency.  For example, within a MONTHLY rule, MO
represents all Mondays within the month.  The BYDAY rule part MUST
NOT be specified with a numeric value when the FREQ rule part is
not set to MONTHLY or YEARLY.  Furthermore, the BYDAY rule part
MUST NOT be specified with a numeric value with the FREQ rule part
set to YEARLY when the BYWEEKNO rule part is specified.

BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner.  BYxxx rule
parts for a period of time that is the same or greater than the
frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of
the recurrence generated.  For example, "FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1"
reduces the number of recurrence instances from all days (if
BYMONTH rule part is not present) to all days in January.  BYxxx
rule parts for a period of time less than the frequency generally
increase or expand the number of occurrences of the recurrence.
For example, "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2" increases the number of
days within the yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH rule part
is not present) to 2.

If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating
the specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts
are applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the
following order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY,
BYHOUR, BYMINUTE, BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are
evaluated.

BYDAY has some special behavior depending on the FREQ value and
this is described in separate notes below the table.

BYDAY has some special behavior depending on the FREQ value 
equals to MONTHLY and YEARLY. 

For MONTHLY, the days should limit if BYMONTHDAY is present; 
otherwise, special expand for MONTHLY.

For YEARLY, limit if BYYEARDAY or BYMONTHDAY is present; otherwise,
special expand for WEEKLY if BYWEEKNO present; otherwise,
special expand for MONTHLY if BYMONTH present; otherwise,
special expand for YEARLY.

Here is an example of evaluating multiple BYxxx rule parts.

DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19970105T083000
RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=2;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU;BYHOUR=8,9;
BYMINUTE=30

First, the "INTERVAL=2" would be applied to "FREQ=YEARLY" to
arrive at "every other year".  Then, "BYMONTH=1" would be applied
to arrive at "every January, every other year".  Then, "BYDAY=SU"
would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January, every
other year".  Then, "BYHOUR=8,9" would be applied to arrive at
"every Sunday in January at 8 AM and 9 AM, every other year".
Then, "BYMINUTE=30" would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in
January at 8:30 AM and 9:30 AM, every other year".  Then, lacking
information from "RRULE", the second is derived from "DTSTART", to
end up in "every Sunday in January at 8:30:00 AM and 9:30:00 AM,
every other year".  Similarly, if the BYMINUTE, BYHOUR, BYDAY,
BYMONTHDAY, or BYMONTH rule part were missing, the appropriate
minute, hour, day, or month would have been retrieved from the
"DTSTART" property.
